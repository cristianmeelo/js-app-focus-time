# Focus Time

This is a pomodoro timer üçÖ application, forked by my professional colleague [Luis Machado](https://github.com/luizgmachado/FocusTime) with ambient background sound options to help you focus with the scenario you find convenient.

## üî® Project features

Using the combination of pomodoro and light music brings with it a series of benefits for the mind, soul and heart. When these two forms of expression come together, they create a unique synergy that amplifies the emotional impact and provides an enriching experience.

Understand the functionality of the app:

- **Play** : activates the timer;
- **Stop** : stops the timer;
- ‚Äã **\+** : increases the timer time by another 5 minutes;
- ‚Äã **\-** : decreases the timer time by 5 minutes.
- **Cards on the right**: when selected, it changes color and starts playing the specific sound, in addition the volume can be controlled by the slide that is under each icon.
- **Button in the upper right corner**: This is where you will switch between **Dark Mode** and **Light Mode**.

## üìö More tutorial information

I was browsing Github, and I came across this project with an amazing design and cool functionality. As I like to program sometimes with a calm background and additionally like the pomodoro methodology, I found the perfect project to `forkar` by [Luis Machado](https://github.com/luizgmachado/FocusTime). However, as I'm evolving as a programmer, I thought of using this project as a test for me to edit other programmers' code, maintain and implement features. I'm creating new cards with background sounds that I find convenient, and the purpose as soon as time gaps arise, to continue implementing other types of background cards!
